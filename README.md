# SeriesChallengeTest
Final project testing importing package, created with three methods used in Main here

 For challenge, I created Series class and JAR library in another project/package,
         then created this new project, imported created JAR library (see above),
         copied the Main I had used for testing underneath. Since other package is imported for this project,
         only requires running of Main to test series methods.

          Challenge: Packages

         Create a suitably named package containing a class called Series
         with the following static methods:
         nSum(int n) returns the sum of all numbers from 0 to n. The first 10 numbers are:
         0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55.

         factorial(int n) returns the product of all numbers from 1 to n
              i.e. 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ... * (n - 1) * n.
         The first 10 factorials are:
         0, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800.

         fibonacci(n) returns the nth Fibonacci number. These are defined as:
         f(0) = 0
         f(1) = 1
         f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
         (so f(2) is also 1. The first 10 fibonacci numbers are:
         0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55.

         When you have tested your functions, delete the Main class and
         produce a jar file.

         Create a new project and add your Series library, then test the
         three methods in the main() method of your new project.
